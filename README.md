# dmsm 1.12.2-1.0.0

lets you create dynmap markers with signs

## perms
To create or destroy markers of type `<marker set id>` a player requires:
`dmsm.<marker set id>`

e.g.

`dmsm.plot`

`dmsm.error`

## how to use
To create or destroy markers of type `<marker set id>` you must write `[<marker set id>]` in the top row of the sign, and nothing else

The other text on the sign will go into the marker's description
